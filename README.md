# Food image Classification 

a machine learning system that can accurately identify the food based on the images we
provide.

In This Project the following are used
 
 * Pytorch
 * ImageClassification
 * DenseNet(a Deep Learning Model)
 * Numpy
 * Matplotlib,SeaBorn



## Run Locally

Download the [https://github.com/Rahulathreya45/Food_classification/blob/main/Food_classification.ipynb] File

Download and import the dataset mentioned here [https://github.com/Rahulathreya45/Food_classification/blob/main/datasetlink.txt.txt]

if you are using google colab then upload the dataset to your drive

Mount the Drive into your Colab Notebook and give appropriate path in your Notebook 
## Appendix
DenseNet take a long time to train the data around 30 mins to 1hr 30 mins 

you can use different versions of DenseNet 

you can reduce the Epoch size for faster completion but the results will not be same
